      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2:08am on Christmas day in Hakone, Japan as I try to think of a good way to start this1. One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling myself for the last three years is that someday I&amp;rsquo;ll maintain a website that&amp;rsquo;s more than just a cryptic online resume. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;d be a data science blog, something along the lines of FiveThiryEight or IQuantNY. Or maybe an online repository of side projects and ideas, the prospect of putting them up for someone else to discover supposedly motivating me to finish them.</description>

      <title>Genetic Engineering with CRISPR-Cas9 Virus-like Particles</title>

      <description>See the paper, poster, and research plan 
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if anyone will ever happen to be on this site looking for resources regarding science fairs, and I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t do as much wet-lab biology as I used to, but as an homage to a past high school obsession passion I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to try to remember some past work.
Some Abstract For some introduction, CRISPR-Cas9 is an exciting gene editing technology with many hyped applications in science and medicine.</description>

Kinases are pretty interesting to me. Sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the best introduction with them - as with most proteins, they were portrayed in AP Biology as either overly simple cartoon squiggly shapes or hopelessly complex ribbon / space-filling models, playing some large role in cell signaling with an equally large number of chemicals and sub-products to memorize. But over time I was able to see past these offenses to arrive at my current sentiment: kinases are kind of cool.</description>

      <title>Turbine Optimization Problem</title>

      <description>Multivariable calculus was a fun time, and for a class project we were tasked with solving a Lagrange optimization problem. This was around the time I started learning about GitHub Pages and hosting websites for various club and activity-related things, so in my youthful enthusiasm I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be cool to turn in a website for the assignment.
Unfortunately for some reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t include the original questions, so it&amp;rsquo;s kind of limited there.</description>

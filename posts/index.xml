      <description>Winter break&amp;rsquo;s been a long one. By now I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to being out of school, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to think that four weeks ago I was in Japan. Family&amp;rsquo;s been on a traveling kick lately, and this year we spent ten days between Tokyo, Kamakura, Hakone, Shanghai, Beijing.
Although I&amp;rsquo;d been to Tokyo for some epsilon-long layovers before, and this time our time in Japan could probably still only be considered a layover (3 out of 10 days woo), I&amp;rsquo;d still consider the recent trip to be the first time I really got to see the country.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2:08am on Christmas day in Hakone, Japan as I try to think of a good way to start this1. One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling myself for the last three years is that someday I&amp;rsquo;ll maintain a website that&amp;rsquo;s more than just a cryptic online resume. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;d be a data science blog, something along the lines of FiveThirtyEight or IQuantNY. Or maybe an online repository of side projects and ideas, the prospect of putting them up for someone else to discover supposedly motivating me to finish them.</description>

      <description>Second part of a two-part series introducing SummerCamp NYC 2018. Also published on Medium here.
Part 2: Location, Location, &amp;hellip; Intern Preferences! If the students make up the heart of SummerCamp, the events bring them together and keep the community running. While ranging in size and nature, none of them would be possible without the fantastic hosts and partner companies we’ve been able to work with over the years, and a big part of organizing SummerCamp involves coordinating and planning for a series of meet-ups over the summer.</description>

Part 1: Meeting the Group of 2018 SummerCamp is a community of Harvard interns in the Bay Area, NYC, Seattle, and now Boston who come together every year to celebrate innovation and technology, focusing on the students and companies at the heart of it all. Through professional and social events, the group aims to connect students with each other, their alums, and leading technology-related companies in the area.</description>

      <title>Mapping Kinases and Viral Drug Connectivity</title>

Kinases are pretty interesting to me. Sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the best introduction with them - as with most proteins, they were portrayed in AP Biology as either overly simple cartoon squiggly shapes or hopelessly complex ribbon / space-filling models, playing some large role in cell signaling with an equally large number of chemicals and sub-products to memorize. But over time I was able to see past these offenses to arrive at my current sentiment: kinases are kind of cool.</description>

      <description>See the paper, poster, and research plan 
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if anyone will ever happen to be on this site looking for resources regarding science fairs, and I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t do as much wet-lab biology as I used to, but as an homage to a past high school obsession passion I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to try to remember some past work.
Some Abstract For some introduction, CRISPR-Cas9 is an exciting gene editing technology with many hyped applications in science and medicine.</description>

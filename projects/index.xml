      <description>Two things I think are pretty cool: the Tokyo subway system and Markov chains. In all seriousness, as a big proponent of learning by doing, I&amp;rsquo;m always trying to figure out how to combine some theory with real-world application, motivated by creating something cool in the process. Coming home from two weeks in Tokyo + Shanghai and a week in the Bay Area at Hack Lodge, it was a fun way to combine some things I knew about for some time (making maps, markov chains), with things I recently learned about (the Tokyo metro, the &amp;ldquo;joys&amp;rdquo; of React and front-end), and a tiny relation to a preview of stuff yet to come (Stat 212 fun&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>Second part of a two-part series introducing SummerCamp NYC 2018. Also published on Medium here.
Part 2: Location, Location, &amp;hellip; Intern Preferences! If the students make up the heart of SummerCamp, the events bring them together and keep the community running. While ranging in size and nature, none of them would be possible without the fantastic hosts and partner companies weâ€™ve been able to work with over the years, and a big part of organizing SummerCamp involves coordinating and planning for a series of meet-ups over the summer.</description>

      <description>See the paper, poster, and research plan 
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if anyone will ever happen to be on this site looking for resources regarding science fairs, and I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t do as much wet-lab biology as I used to, but as an homage to a past high school obsession passion I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to try to remember some past work.
Some Abstract For some introduction, CRISPR-Cas9 is an exciting gene editing technology with many hyped applications in science and medicine.</description>

      <title>Turbine Optimization Problem</title>

      <description>Multivariable calculus was a fun time, and for a class project we were tasked with solving a Lagrange optimization problem. This was around the time I started learning about GitHub Pages and hosting websites for various club and activity-related things, so in my youthful enthusiasm I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be cool to turn in a website for the assignment.
Unfortunately for some reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t include the original questions, so it&amp;rsquo;s kind of limited there.</description>

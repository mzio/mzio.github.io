I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if anyone will ever happen to be on this site looking for resources regarding science fairs, and I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t do as much wet-lab biology as I used to, but as an homage to a past high school obsession passion I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to try to remember some past work.

This was around the time I started learning about GitHub Pages and hosting websites for various club and activity-related things, so in my youthful enthusiasm I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be cool to turn in a website for the assignment.
Unfortunately for some reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t include the original questions, so it&amp;rsquo;s kind of limited there.</description>

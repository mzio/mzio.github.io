Kinases are pretty interesting to me. Sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the best introduction with them - as with most proteins, they were portrayed in AP Biology as either overly simple cartoon squiggly shapes or hopelessly complex ribbon / space-filling models, playing some large role in cell signaling with an equally large number of chemicals and sub-products to memorize. But over time I was able to see past these offenses to arrive at my current sentiment: kinases are kind of cool.</description>

      <description>See the paper, poster, and research plan 
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if anyone will ever happen to be on this site looking for resources regarding science fairs, and I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t do as much wet-lab biology as I used to, but as an homage to a past high school obsession passion I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to try to remember some past work.
Some Abstract For some introduction, CRISPR-Cas9 is an exciting gene editing technology with many hyped applications in science and medicine.</description>

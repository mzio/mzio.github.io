      <description>Two things I think are pretty cool: the Tokyo subway system and Markov chains. In all seriousness, as a big proponent of learning by doing, I&amp;rsquo;m always trying to figure out how to combine some theory with real-world application, motivated by creating something cool in the process. Coming home from two weeks in Tokyo + Shanghai and a week in the Bay Area at Hack Lodge, it was a fun way to combine some things I knew about for some time (making maps, markov chains), with things I recently learned about (the Tokyo metro, the &amp;ldquo;joys&amp;rdquo; of React and front-end), and a tiny relation to a preview of stuff yet to come (Stat 212 fun&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>Second part of a two-part series introducing SummerCamp NYC 2018. Also published on Medium here.
Part 2: Location, Location, &amp;hellip; Intern Preferences! If the students make up the heart of SummerCamp, the events bring them together and keep the community running. While ranging in size and nature, none of them would be possible without the fantastic hosts and partner companies we’ve been able to work with over the years, and a big part of organizing SummerCamp involves coordinating and planning for a series of meet-ups over the summer.</description>

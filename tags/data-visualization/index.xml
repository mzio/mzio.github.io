      <description>Two things I think are pretty cool: the Tokyo subway system and Markov chains. In all seriousness, as a big proponent of learning by doing, I&amp;rsquo;m always trying to figure out how to combine some theory with real-world application, motivated by creating something cool in the process. Coming home from two weeks in Tokyo + Shanghai and a week in the Bay Area at Hack Lodge, it was a fun way to combine some things I knew about for some time (making maps, markov chains), with things I recently learned about (the Tokyo metro, the &amp;ldquo;joys&amp;rdquo; of React and front-end), and a tiny relation to a preview of stuff yet to come (Stat 212 fun&amp;hellip;).</description>

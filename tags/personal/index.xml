      <description>Winter break&amp;rsquo;s been a long one. By now I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to being out of school, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to think that four weeks ago I was in Japan. Family&amp;rsquo;s been on a traveling kick lately, and this year we spent ten days between Tokyo, Kamakura, Hakone, Shanghai, and Beijing.
Although I&amp;rsquo;d been to Tokyo for some epsilon-long layovers before, and this time our time in Japan could probably still only be considered a layover (3 out of 10 days woo), I&amp;rsquo;d still consider the recent trip to be the first time I really got to see the country.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2:08am on Christmas day in Hakone, Japan as I try to think of a good way to start this1. One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling myself for the last three years is that someday I&amp;rsquo;ll maintain a website that&amp;rsquo;s more than just a cryptic online resume. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;d be a data science blog, something along the lines of FiveThirtyEight or IQuantNY. Or maybe an online repository of side projects and ideas, the prospect of putting them up for someone else to discover supposedly motivating me to finish them.</description>
